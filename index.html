          <b>Q. Why 82&deg30'E has been selected as the Standard Meridian of India?</b><br>
          
          <u>Earth take 4 minute to complete the rotation of 1&deg. Therefore there is a lag of approximate 30&deg between eastern most point of india(Arunachal Pardesh) and westernmost point of india(Gujarat). So total time taken to complete the rotation = 4*30 = 120 minute i.e.2hour so to keep the accurate time in the whole country it is taken as the Standard Meridian which passes through Uttar Pardesh in Mirzapur

          <b>Q. Why is the difference between the duation of day and night hardly felt at kannyakumari but  not so in kashmir?</b><br>
          
          <u>The difference between the duration of day and night is hardly felt at Kanyakumari because it is located near the Equator. At places close to the Equator, the length of day and night remains almost equal throughout the year, so there is very little variation. On the other hand, Kashmir lies much farther north from the Equator. Due to the tilt of the Earthâ€™s axis, regions away from the Equator experience a greater difference in the duration of day and night with changing seasons. Therefore, while Kanyakumari has nearly equal days and nights, Kashmir shows a big variation between the two.
